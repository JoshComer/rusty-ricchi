# rusty-ricchi

A rust implementation of Ricchi Mahjong

The game currently is barely playable. The AI only discard leftmost tiles, score doesn't change upon winning, and there's plenty of bugs.
This was created as an attempt to learn rust. It's my first project in the language, and as such BADLY needs to be refactored. Be wary of the code for now, because it's pretty scary

# running
Build and run with cargo. Feel free to run tests as well

# tests
There's hundreds of lines of tests to make sure the game's logic is correct. The tests also eventually should be refactored though
